One of the simplest two-player games is “Guess the number”. The first player thinks of a secret number in some known range while the second player attempts to guess the number. After each guess, the first player answers either “Higher”, “Lower” or “Correct!” depending on whether the secret number is higher, lower or equal to the guess. 

In this project the computer will take the role of the first player while the user play as the second player.

The user interacts with the program using an input field and several buttons. For this project, the canvas will be ignored and the computer's responses will be printed directly in the console.

The script runs locally from the command line but it does require the modules listed below.  Make sure you install them first (pip install {module name}).
